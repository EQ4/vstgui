@page intro Introduction

\par VSTGUI 
VSTGUI is a User Interface Toolkit mainly for Audio PlugIns (VST, AudioUnit, etc).
\par History
First developed inhouse of Steinberg Media Technologies (around 1998) for their first VST PlugIns. 
Later added as binary libraries to the official VST SDK. 
Since May 2003 VSTGUI is open source and hosted at sourceforge.
\par Platforms
Currently VSTGUI compiles on Microsoft Windows 2000/ME/XP/XP64 and Apple Mac OS X 10.2 - 10.4. 
With some tweaking it can also run on Windows 98 and Mac OS 9.
\note 
The BeOS branch is currently not mentained and may be removed in the future.
