	* Added Carbon Events handling (#define CARBON_EVENTS 1)
	* Implemented QUARTZ drawing. (#define QUARTZ 1)
	* CSlider doesn't use a COffscreenContext for drawing on MacOSX anymore

	Quartz Notes:
		- Not all graphic operations we use in vstgui have an equivalent in quartz.
			Currently unsupported are : 
				- all drawing modes except kCopyMode
				- getPoint ()
				_ floodFill ()
				- copy from Screen to Offscreen

		- to support alpha drawing on all operations I have made changes to CColor. The 4th variable is now the alpha value where 255 is opaque and 0 is transparent.
		- transparent bitmap drawing is now handled with the alpha value of the bitmap, if you want the old behaviour turn on OLD_TRANSPARENT_BITMAP_MODE
		- because of some strange things with CViewContainers while doing mouse downs the drawcontext has an offset which results in wrong drawing. This needs to be fixed !!!
