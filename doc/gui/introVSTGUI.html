			<h1>VSTGUI Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Providing an interface to your Plug-In makes you be immediately confronted with 
				platform specifics of different windows handling and event handling models.<br>
				For this very reason, the <STRONG>VSTGUI</STRONG> libraries have been created. 
				These are available for all supported platforms and make the handling of user 
				interaction with a graphic-rich user interface also cross-platform.<br>
				Thus they propose common objects for plugs's GUI, like <STRONG>knobs</STRONG>, <STRONG>
					sliders</STRONG> ...and of course nothing prevents you from adding via 
				inheritance any more specific components you should need.<br>
				<br>
				The only proviso to the cross-platform property of <STRONG>VSTGUI</STRONG> is 
				that you need to be able to convert your source graphics from one platform 
				format to another. But many third-parts tools help you to do this quickly and 
				simply.
			</p>
			<P>You can find a Plugin example using some controls in the SDK (see under 
				Examples), you can find on the Steinberg web 3rd Party Developers some links to 
				web page proposing some extended Control objects.</P>
