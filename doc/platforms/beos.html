<h2>BeOS</h2>
    		   
<h2>Pixmaps :</h2>
    		   
<p>VST-GUI's images should be stored as BeOS resources in the plug-in itself. 
  			VST-GUI uses BeOS's translation kit to load the images, so that you may
 store  			your images in any image format supported by BeOS's translation 
 kit.</p>
    		   
<p>However, we advise that you use *only* BeOS standard translators so that 
 your  			users won't have any surprise because the plug-in requires some 
obscure  			translator to be installed, or because the translator you've installed
with  			your plug-in is gone for some reason.</p>
    		   
<p>Each image that you use in your plug-in is identified by an id number.</p>
    		   
<p>Store your image using that particular id as resource id number, and <code>B_RAW_TYPE</code>
  			(<code>'RAWT'</code>) as resource type. The resource's name is ignored. 
 You may  			use it as you wish.</p>
    		   
<p>To build your BeOS resources, you may simply want to use the BeOS provided 
  			command line utility called <code>'mwbres'</code>. Its use is straightforward, 
  			at least when you have a working example. Look for the BeOS resource 
examples  			for more information. If you are reading this page on a BeOS 
system using R4.5,  			then you should find the official documentation here:</p>

  			/boot/beos/documentation/Be Book/Release Notes/BeIDE/BeIDE_mwbres.html</a>
  		   
<p>Once your resource file is built, then simply add that file in your plug-in's 
  			BeIDE project, or add theses resources manually to your binary with the
  			command:</p>
    		   
<blockquote><code>mergeres the_resource_file.rsrc plugin_file</code></blockquote>
